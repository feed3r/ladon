## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Generic SES protocol types** — `Ref[RawT]`,
  `Expansion[RecordT, ChildRawT]`, `Source`, `Expander`, `Sink`,
  `CrawlPlugin`, and `CrawlPlan` now preserve concrete adapter types under
  strict type checking. New `OnLeafCallback` / `OnPlannedLeafCallback` type
  aliases and async equivalents let adapter authors annotate callbacks
  precisely.
- **`SyncHttpClientProtocol` / `AsyncHttpClientProtocol`** — public structural
  HTTP client contracts implemented by both native and curl-cffi backends.
- **`run_plugin()` / `async_run_plugin()`** — source-driven whole-plugin
  entry points. They discover roots once, preserve one `RunResult` per root,
  and return aggregate counts and source-indexed errors in `PluginRunResult`.
- **`Verdict` and `FetchPredicate.evaluate()`** — three-valued predicate
  results make `ACCEPT`, `CONTINUE`, and `REJECT` explicit. Rejected candidates
  are excluded from acceptance and fallback selection while remaining sources
  are searched; `AllOf`, `AnyOf`, and `Not` preserve `REJECT` as an absolute
  veto.
- **`rejection_info()`** — optional duck-typed extension point on
  `FetchPredicate` implementations for adding predicate-specific diagnostics
  to `predicate_rejected` decision-event metadata.

### Deprecated

- **`FetchPredicate.accepts() -> bool`** — use `evaluate() -> Verdict` instead.
  The boolean API remains supported for one full minor release and emits a
  `DeprecationWarning` on every legacy invocation.

### Removed

- **`RetryableHttpError`** — the deprecated alias for `TransientNetworkError`
  announced for removal in v0.1.0. Three minor releases past that
  announcement, it is removed in this release. Use `TransientNetworkError`
  directly.

### Fixed

- **Backend-agnostic adapter and runner typing** — `Source`, `Expander`,
  `Sink`, their async counterparts, and runner signatures now accept either
  native or curl-cffi factory results under strict type checking.
- **Polite retry pacing** — retries now enforce per-host rate limits, including
  robots.txt `Crawl-delay` overrides, on every attempt and merge that wait with
  Retry-After or backoff into one sleep. The default backoff is now a safe
  `0.5` seconds; explicitly setting zero with retries enabled emits a warning.
- **Consistent runner leaf-exception semantics** — sync crawls now record an
  unexpected non-fatal `Sink.consume()` exception and continue with remaining
  leaves instead of aborting and losing the partial result. Async crawls now
  propagate leaf cancellation instead of silently counting it as a failure.
  Consequently, the CLI now exits with code 2 for an ordinary
  `Sink.consume()` exception recorded as a partial leaf failure; exit code 1
  remains reserved for exceptions the runner does not isolate.
- **Circuit-breaker HTTP 5xx accounting** — returned 5xx responses now count
  as origin-health failures without changing their `Ok(...)` result contract;
  non-retryable 4xx responses remain successful breaker outcomes.
- **Async politeness under concurrency** — same-host requests now reserve
  rate-limit slots instead of waking in a batch, and HALF_OPEN circuit
  breakers admit exactly one probe. Both guards are cancellation-safe and
  remain independent across hosts.

### Changed

- **Breaking: planned-crawl callback keyword renamed** —
  `execute_plan_sync(..., on_leaf=...)` and `execute_plan(..., on_leaf=...)`
  must now use `on_planned_leaf=`, making their `(leaf_record, leaf_ref)`
  contract distinct from the runners' `(leaf_record, parent_record)` callback.

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-06-08

### Added

- **`CrawlPlan`** — immutable Phase 1 output carrying `record`, `leaves`,
  and `errors`.  Filter with `excluding(predicate)` or `limited_to(n)`
  before passing to `execute_plan_sync` / `execute_plan`.
- **`plan_crawl_sync` / `plan_crawl`** — Phase 1 only: traverse all
  expanders and return a `CrawlPlan` without calling the sink.
- **`execute_plan_sync` / `execute_plan`** — Phase 3 only: consume an
  existing plan against the sink.  `on_leaf` receives
  `(leaf_record, leaf_ref)` — the leaf ref, **not** a parent record
  (ADR-016).  Optional `on_progress(done, total)` callback for real-time
  progress reporting.
- **`ladon.observability`** — `DecisionEvent` dataclass, `DecisionTracker`
  Protocol, and `NullDecisionTracker` no-op default (same pattern as
  `MetricsBackend` / `NullMetrics` from ADR-009).  All three re-exported
  from the top-level `ladon` namespace.
- **`MultiSourceSink.resolve_multi(run_id=)`** — optional correlation key
  (auto-UUID if omitted) shared across all events from one resolution call.
  Eight event types emitted at five hook points: `source_skipped`,
  `source_failed`, `candidate_accepted`, `candidate_rejected`,
  `predicate_rejected`, `resolved` (`via_fallback=True/False`), `no_result`.
- **`ladon.contrib.sqlite_tracker.SqliteDecisionTracker`** — append-only
  SQLite backend with three indexes (run_id, ref, event), `query()` method
  for post-run SQL analysis, and context-manager support.

### Fixed

- **`MultiSourceSink`** — non-`NotImplementedError` exceptions from
  `_fetch_from_source` are now caught, recorded as `source_failed`, and
  the loop continues instead of propagating.  `NotImplementedError` is
  re-raised to preserve the subclass contract.

---

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-20

### Added

- **`ladon.mcp.LadonMCPAdapter`** — abstract base class for adapter packages that
  want to expose data-plane MCP tools via `ladon-nous`. Adapters implement
  `adapter_name`, `mcp_tools()`, and optionally `mcp_resources()`, then declare
  themselves via the `ladon.mcp` Python entry-point group. No `fastmcp` import in
  core — only `ladon-nous` requires that dependency.

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-18

### Added

- **`cffi` optional dependency group** — `pip install ladon-crawl[cffi]` installs
  `curl-cffi>=0.11,<1`, enabling the `CurlHttpClient` and `AsyncCurlHttpClient`
  backends for Cloudflare-protected targets (issue #107).

- **`CurlHttpClient` / `AsyncCurlHttpClient`** — sync and async HTTP clients
  backed by curl-cffi.  Mirror all policies of `HttpClient` / `AsyncHttpClient`
  (retries, exponential backoff, circuit breaker, proxy rotation, rate limiting)
  but use TLS fingerprint impersonation (JA3/JA4) to bypass Cloudflare L1+L2
  challenges without browser automation.  Both are exported from `ladon.networking`
  and the top-level `ladon` namespace.

- **`HttpClientConfig(backend=, impersonate=)`** — two new fields select the
  HTTP backend without changing call sites.  `backend="curl-cffi"` (requires
  `impersonate`) returns a `CurlHttpClient` / `AsyncCurlHttpClient` from the
  factory helpers.  Default is `backend="requests"` (unchanged behaviour).

- **`make_http_client()` / `make_async_http_client()`** — factory helpers that
  instantiate the correct sync or async client based on `config.backend`.
  Exported from `ladon.networking` and the top-level `ladon` namespace.

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **Async crawling via `async_run_crawl()`** — asyncio-native counterpart to
  `run_crawl()`.  Phase 1 (expander traversal) is sequential `await`; Phase 3
  (sink) issues leaf fetches concurrently behind
  `asyncio.Semaphore(config.async_concurrency)` (default 10).  Each semaphore
  slot covers the full `sink.consume()` + `on_leaf` pair so callbacks are
  naturally isolated.  `LeafUnavailableError` is isolated per leaf (other
  leaves continue); `ExpansionNotReadyError` remains globally fatal.
  `RunConfig` gains `async_concurrency: int = 10`; `AsyncHttpClient` and
  `async_run_crawl` are exported from the top-level `ladon` namespace.

- **`AsyncHttpClient`** — full async HTTP client backed by `httpx`.  Mirrors
  all policies of `HttpClient` (retries, exponential backoff, full-jitter,
  429/503 Retry-After, circuit breaker, proxy rotation, HTTP auth,
  `default_params`, `default_headers`).  `respect_robots_txt=True` raises
  `NotImplementedError` at construction time (deferred to a later release).
  Exported from `ladon.networking` and the top-level `ladon` namespace.

- **Async plugin protocols** — `AsyncSource`, `AsyncExpander`, `AsyncSink`,
  and `AsyncCrawlPlugin` structural protocols (PEP 544, all
  `@runtime_checkable`).  All four are exported from `ladon.plugins` and the
  top-level `ladon` namespace.  The sync protocol hierarchy is untouched.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- **HTTP authentication** — `HttpClientConfig(auth=("user", "pass"))` for HTTP Basic Auth;
  `auth=HTTPDigestAuth("user", "pass")` or any `requests.auth.AuthBase` subclass for Digest
  and custom schemes (HMAC signing, OAuth token injection). Wired directly to
  `requests.Session.auth`. Tuple length validated at construction. Bearer tokens and static
  API keys remain in `default_headers` as before.

- **Default query parameters** — `HttpClientConfig(default_params={"api_key": "..."})` injects
  query parameters into every request. Per-request `params` take precedence on key collision,
  matching the same override contract as `default_headers`. Frozen via `MappingProxyType`.
  Useful for API keys that must appear in the query string.

- **`params` kwarg on `post()` and `download()`** — symmetry with `get()` and `head()`;
  merged with `default_params` in the same way.

- **Proxy rotation via `ProxyPool`** — `HttpClientConfig(proxy_pool=RoundRobinProxyPool([...]))`
  rotates through a list of proxies on every request attempt. Custom rotation strategies
  are supported through the `ProxyPool` protocol (`next_proxy()` / `mark_failure()`);
  `mark_failure()` is called on transport errors and rate-limit responses so
  implementations can apply cooldowns or exclusions. Mutually exclusive with `proxies`.
  `validate_proxy(mapping)` is exported from `ladon.networking` as a public helper for
  custom pool implementations.

- **Static proxy support** — `HttpClientConfig(proxies={"https": "http://proxy:8080"})`
  routes all session traffic through a proxy. Follows `requests` conventions;
  SOCKS proxies supported when `requests[socks]` is installed. Proxy URLs are
  validated at config construction time (scheme must be `http`, `https`, `socks4`,
  `socks4h`, `socks5`, or `socks5h`).

- **HTTP 429 / 503 with Retry-After respect** — `HttpClientConfig(retry_on_status=...)`
  automatically retries safe methods on configurable status codes (default `{429, 503}`).
  The `Retry-After` header is honoured in both delta-seconds and HTTP-date forms (RFC 7231
  §7.1.3); capped at `max_retry_after_seconds` (default 300 s). Raises `RateLimitedError`
  when retries are exhausted.

- **Full-jitter exponential backoff** — `HttpClientConfig(backoff_jitter=True)` draws
  each retry sleep from `uniform(0, base × 2^attempt)` instead of the deterministic cap,
  preventing thundering-herd spikes when multiple crawlers restart simultaneously.

- **`RateLimitedError`** — new error class (subclass of `HttpClientError`) with
  `status_code: int` and `retry_after: float | None` attributes; exported at both
  `ladon.networking` and `ladon` levels.

---

## [0.0.1] — 2026-04-17

First public release.

### Added

- **SES pipeline** — Source / Expander / Sink architecture for structured,
  typed web crawls (`runner.py`, `run_crawl()`)
- **`CrawlPlugin` protocol** — typed adapter interface enforcing Source,
  Expander, and Sink roles (ADR-003); `ladon-hackernews` is the canonical
  reference implementation
- **`Repository` + `RunAudit` protocols** — persistence layer with structural
  subtyping; `NullRepository` for dry runs and testing (ADR-006)
- **`LocalFileStorage`** — zero-config file storage backend
- **HTTP client** — circuit breaker, configurable retry/backoff, `robots.txt`
  support (`--respect-robots-txt` flag)
- **CLI** — `ladon run` and `ladon info`; exit codes 0 (success) / 1 (leaf
  errors) / 2 (fatal) / 3 (robots.txt blocked)
- **`RunResult` counters** — `leaves_consumed`, `leaves_persisted`,
  `leaves_failed` (renamed from `leaves_fetched` in this release)
- **`py.typed` marker** — full type checking support (PEP 561)
- **Dual-license model** — AGPL-3.0-only open source + commercial license
  option (`LICENSE-COMMERCIAL`); CLA required for contributors (ADR-010)

### Known limitations

- `RunResult` counter semantics are scheduled for redesign in v0.1.0
  (issue [#62](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon/issues/62)) — the
  current counters are correct but the model will be simplified
- Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 supported; 3.10 and below are not

"""Ladon crawl runner — the core orchestrator.

The runner drives the crawl loop for a single top-level ref:
  1. Traverse plugin.expanders in order, each expanding the refs
     produced by the previous one (multi-level tree traversal).
  2. For each leaf ref produced by the last expander, call
     plugin.sink.consume().
  3. Invoke ``on_leaf`` callback after each successful consume.

Persistence (DB writes, file serialization) is the caller's
responsibility and is injected via the ``on_leaf`` callback. The runner
itself has no DB dependency.

``ExpansionNotReadyError`` is assumed to be a globally premature
condition: when any expander raises it, the run is aborted immediately
and the exception propagates to the caller. The caller must treat it as
"not yet ready" and schedule a retry on the next run — it is never
silently swallowed or converted into a partial result.

The plan/execute split (v0.3):
  ``plan_crawl_sync`` runs Phase 1 only and returns a ``CrawlPlan``.
  ``execute_plan_sync`` runs Phase 3 against an existing plan.
  ``run_crawl`` remains a self-contained Phase 1+3 entry point with the
  original ``on_leaf(leaf_record, parent_record)`` contract.
  ``execute_plan_sync``'s ``on_leaf`` receives ``(leaf_record, leaf_ref)``
  per ADR-011 — different from ``run_crawl``'s contract.

    """Run Phase 3 (leaf fetching) against an existing CrawlPlan.

    Args:
        plan:        Plan produced by ``plan_crawl_sync()``.
        plugin:      Crawl plugin whose sink consumes each leaf.
        client:      Configured HttpClient instance.
        config:      Run-level configuration (leaf_limit; async_concurrency ignored).
                     If the plan was already narrowed with ``CrawlPlan.limited_to()``,
                     both caps apply independently — the tighter of the two wins.
        on_leaf:     Optional callback receiving ``(leaf_record, leaf_ref)``
                     after each successful consume.  Note: second argument is the
                     **leaf ref**, not a parent record (see ADR-011).
        on_progress: Optional callback receiving ``(leaves_done, total_leaves)``
                     after each leaf attempt (success or failure).  Ordinary
                     ``Exception`` subclasses raised by this callback are logged
                     and swallowed.  A ``BaseException`` propagates instead,
                     pre-empting a pending fatal plugin exception under the
                     severity-tier convention while preserving it in
                     ``__context__``.

    Returns:
        RunResult with counts and any per-leaf error messages.  Phase 1
        errors from the plan are carried forward into ``RunResult.errors``.

    Raises:
        ExpansionNotReadyError: Raised from the Sink and propagates.
        PartialExpansionError: Raised from the Sink and propagates.
        ChildListUnavailableError: Raised from the Sink and propagates.
        AssetDownloadError: Raised from the Sink. This explicitly fatal
                            plugin error propagates.
        BaseException:      KeyboardInterrupt and other fatal errors raised by
                            the Sink or ``on_leaf`` propagate unchanged.

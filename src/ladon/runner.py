"""Ladon crawl runner — the core orchestrator.

The runner drives the crawl loop for a single top-level ref:
  1. Traverse plugin.expanders in order, each expanding the refs
     produced by the previous one (multi-level tree traversal).
  2. For each leaf ref produced by the last expander, call
     plugin.sink.consume().
  3. Invoke ``on_leaf`` callback after each successful consume.

Persistence (DB writes, file serialization) is the caller's
responsibility and is injected via the ``on_leaf`` callback. The runner
itself has no DB dependency.

``ExpansionNotReadyError`` is assumed to be a globally premature
condition: when any expander raises it, the run is aborted immediately
and the exception propagates to the caller. The caller must treat it as
"not yet ready" and schedule a retry on the next run — it is never
silently swallowed or converted into a partial result.

The plan/execute split (v0.3):
  ``plan_crawl_sync`` runs Phase 1 only and returns a ``CrawlPlan``.
  ``execute_plan_sync`` runs Phase 3 against an existing plan.
  ``run_crawl`` remains a self-contained Phase 1+3 entry point with the
  original ``on_leaf(leaf_record, parent_record)`` contract.
  ``execute_plan_sync``'s ``on_leaf`` receives ``(leaf_record, leaf_ref)``
  per ADR-011 — different from ``run_crawl``'s contract.

"""Ladon crawl runner — the core orchestrator.

The runner drives the crawl loop for a single top-level ref:
  1. Traverse plugin.expanders in order, each expanding the refs
     produced by the previous one (multi-level tree traversal).
  2. For each leaf ref produced by the last expander, call
     plugin.sink.consume().
  3. Invoke ``on_leaf`` callback after each successful consume.

Persistence (DB writes, file serialization) is the caller's
responsibility and is injected via the ``on_leaf`` callback. The runner
itself has no DB dependency.

``ExpansionNotReadyError`` is assumed to be a globally premature
condition: when any expander raises it, the run is aborted immediately
and the exception propagates to the caller. The caller must treat it as
"not yet ready" and schedule a retry on the next run — it is never
silently swallowed or converted into a partial result.

    ``leaves_consumed`` counts leaves for which ``sink.consume()`` succeeded,

    ``leaves_persisted`` counts leaves for which the full pipeline succeeded:
    ``sink.consume()`` completed *and* the ``on_leaf`` callback completed
    without raising.  When no callback is supplied, ``leaves_persisted``
    equals ``leaves_consumed`` (the pipeline trivially succeeds after consume).

    ``leaves_failed`` counts leaves for which ``sink.consume()`` failed.
    Callback failures are NOT included here — derive them from
    ``leaves_consumed - leaves_persisted``.

    The following invariant always holds::

        leaves_consumed + leaves_failed == total leaves passed to Phase 3
                                          (after leaf_limit is applied)

    ``errors`` accumulates both expander branch failures (Phase 1, format
    ``"expander branch '...': ..."`` ) and leaf-level failures (Phase 3,
    format ``"ref[N]: ..."`` ).  A result with ``leaves_failed == 0`` may
    still contain branch errors — always inspect ``errors`` for a complete
    picture of what went wrong.

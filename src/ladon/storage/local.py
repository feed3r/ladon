"""LocalFileStorage — filesystem-backed Storage implementation.

Writes are atomic on POSIX: data is written to a temporary file in the
same directory as the target, then renamed over it. ``os.replace`` is
atomic on POSIX (same filesystem is guaranteed because the temp file is
created in the target's parent directory).

``sync=True`` (default) calls ``os.fsync`` before the rename, ensuring
durability across power loss. ``sync=False`` is provided for tests where
fsync overhead is unacceptable and durability is not required.

"""typing.Protocol definitions for Ladon crawl plugins.

Adapters implement these protocols by structural subtyping — no
inheritance from this module is required. This keeps third-party
plugins decoupled from Ladon internals.

All adapters receive an object satisfying ``SyncHttpClientProtocol``: either
the native ``HttpClient`` or curl-cffi ``CurlHttpClient`` implementation. They
must not construct their own HTTP sessions or import ``requests`` directly.

The three-layer pipeline is:

    Source  →  [Expander, ...]  →  Sink

``Source`` produces top-level refs. Each ``Expander`` takes a ref and
returns an ``Expansion`` (record + child refs). ``Sink`` takes a leaf
ref and returns a final record. ``CrawlPlugin`` bundles all three.

    ``name`` is a short identifier used in log lines and error messages
    (e.g. ``"acme_shop"``, ``"widgetco"``). ``source`` produces
    top-level refs. ``expanders`` is an ordered list of expansion steps
    (one per tree level above the leaves). ``sink`` consumes the leaf
    refs produced by the last expander.

    CLI convention
    --------------
    When loaded via ``ladon run --plugin module:Class``, the CLI
    instantiates the plugin as ``plugin_cls(client=client)``.  Adapters
    intended for CLI use **must** accept ``client`` as a keyword argument
    in ``__init__``.  This constraint is not enforced by the Protocol
    check — it is a CLI convention only and not part of this protocol.

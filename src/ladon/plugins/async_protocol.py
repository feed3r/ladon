"""typing.Protocol definitions for async Ladon crawl plugins.

Async adapters implement these protocols by structural subtyping — no
inheritance from this module is required.

All async adapters receive an object satisfying ``AsyncHttpClientProtocol``:
either the native ``AsyncHttpClient`` or curl-cffi ``AsyncCurlHttpClient``
implementation. They must not construct their own HTTP sessions or import
``httpx`` directly.

The three-layer pipeline is:

    AsyncSource  →  [AsyncExpander, ...]  →  AsyncSink

``AsyncSource`` discovers top-level refs. Each ``AsyncExpander`` awaits
a ref and returns an ``Expansion``. ``AsyncSink`` awaits a leaf ref and
returns a final record. ``AsyncCrawlPlugin`` bundles all three.

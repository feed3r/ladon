"""Error taxonomy for Ladon house plugins.

Each exception maps to a specific runner behaviour. Expansion signals remain
typed because they describe tree completeness; non-fatal Phase-3 exceptions
are recorded independently so one bad leaf does not discard the rest of a run.

    response returned fewer items than the declared total).

    Runner behaviour: non-fatal for non-first expanders — the affected

    unchanged from the first expander. Always fatal from a Sink because
    Phase 3 has no branch to isolate.

    Raise this instead of ``ChildListUnavailableError`` when the HTTP
    response was valid but the payload signals an incomplete result.
    Raise ``ChildListUnavailableError`` when the response could not be
    parsed or the request itself failed.

"""Ladon async crawl runner — asyncio-based orchestrator.

Mirrors the behaviour of ``runner.run_crawl()`` but drives the crawl with
asyncio:
  1. Phase 1 — expanders are awaited sequentially (fan-out is small).
  2. Phase 3 — sink calls are issued concurrently behind an
     ``asyncio.Semaphore(config.async_concurrency)`` to bound the number of
     in-flight requests.

The plan/execute split (v0.3):
  ``plan_crawl`` runs Phase 1 only and returns a ``CrawlPlan``.
  ``execute_plan`` runs Phase 3 against an existing plan.
  ``async_run_crawl`` remains a self-contained Phase 1+3 entry point with the
  original ``on_leaf(leaf_record, parent_record)`` contract.
  ``execute_plan``'s ``on_leaf`` receives ``(leaf_record, leaf_ref)``
  per ADR-011 — different from ``async_run_crawl``'s contract.

``ExpansionNotReadyError`` retains the same globally-fatal semantics as in
the sync runner: when any expander raises it, the coroutine raises immediately
and the caller must schedule a retry.

Ordinary exceptions from a leaf ``consume()`` call are isolated per leaf and
recorded in ``RunResult.errors``. ``AssetDownloadError`` retains its explicitly
fatal contract, while cancellation and other ``BaseException`` subclasses
propagate unchanged.

``asyncio.gather(return_exceptions=True)`` is used deliberately so sibling
leaf tasks finish before a fatal exception or cancellation is propagated.

class RunRecord:
    """Audit record for a single ``run_crawl()`` invocation.

    Created twice per run by the orchestration layer:

    1. At run start — ``status='running'``, ``finished_at=None``, all
       counters at zero.
    2. At run finish — ``status`` set to the final outcome, ``finished_at``
       populated, counters filled from ``RunResult``.

    ``RunAudit.record_run`` must treat both calls as an **upsert on
    ``run_id``** — it is always called twice per run.

    ``branch_errors`` counts expander branch failures (Phase 1 failures
    isolated by the bulkhead). These appear in ``errors`` with the prefix
    ``"expander branch '...':"`` and are counted separately for dashboards.

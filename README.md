A Python framework for building structured, resumable web crawlers — designed
for domains where data quality matters.

## What is Ladon?

Ladon enforces typed domain objects at every stage of the crawl pipeline
through the SES protocol (Source / Expander / Sink). The difference from
Scrapy — a proven, mature tool — is structural: instead of weakly typed
`scrapy.Item` fields, you define typed dataclasses at the protocol level
(e.g. a `CommentRecord` with enforced field types). The output is structured
and typed without a post-processing step. This matters when the destination
is an LLM training pipeline or any domain where schema correctness is not optional.

The built-in HTTP layer handles retries, exponential back-off with optional
full-jitter, 429/503 Retry-After respect, per-domain rate limiting, circuit
breaking, static and rotating proxy support, and robots.txt enforcement — so
adapter authors focus on domain logic, not infrastructure.

## Quick start

The canonical example is
[`ladon-hackernews`](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon-hackernews) —
an adapter that crawls the HN top-stories list and writes comments to DuckDB:

```bash
pip install ladon-crawl ladon-hackernews
ladon-hackernews --top 30 --out hn.db
```

No authentication. No external server. 30 stories and their comments in
under a minute.

## The LLM training pipeline

```
ladon-hackernews --top 500 --out hn.db
    → export_parquet("hn.db", "hn.parquet")
        → training pipeline
```

HN comments are structured, human-authored, and high signal-to-noise. The
full pipeline from install to Parquet takes under five minutes. Each run
writes a `ladon_runs` audit table to the DuckDB file — re-running skips
stories already marked `done`, giving you resumable crawls for free.

```python
from ladon_hackernews import export_parquet
export_parquet("hn.db", "hn.parquet")
```

## Writing your own adapter

`ladon-hackernews` is the canonical reference for building an adapter.
Adapters implement the SES protocol **structurally** — no inheritance from
any Ladon base class is required. The three components to implement are:

- **Source** — discovers the list of root references to crawl
- **Expander** — maps a reference to a domain record and child references
- **Sink** — receives each leaf record for persistence or downstream use

See the [adapter authoring guide](https://moonyfringers.github.io/ladon/) and
[ADR-003](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon/blob/main/docs/decisions/adr-003-plugin-adapter-interface.md)
for the full protocol specification. The
[`ladon-hackernews` source](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon-hackernews)
is the worked example.

## CLI reference

```
ladon info
ladon run --plugin MODULE:CLASS --ref URL [--respect-robots-txt]
ladon --version
```

| command | description |
|---|---|
| `ladon info` | Print Ladon version, Python version, and platform |
| `ladon run` | Run a crawl using a dynamically loaded plugin class |
| `ladon --version` | Print the installed version |

`ladon run` flags:

| flag | required | description |
|---|---|---|
| `--plugin MODULE:CLASS` | yes | Dotted import path to the `CrawlPlugin` class |
| `--ref URL` | yes | Top-level reference URL passed to the plugin |
| `--respect-robots-txt` | no | Honour `Disallow` rules and `Crawl-delay` directives |

Exit codes: `0` success · `1` fatal error · `2` partial failures · `3` data not ready (retry later)

`ladon run` uses default `HttpClientConfig` settings. For retries, rate
limiting, circuit breaking, or a persistence layer, call `run_plugin()`
directly from Python; use `run_crawl()` when your application already owns a
single top-level ref — see
[`ladon-hackernews` — Use as a library](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon-hackernews#use-as-a-library)
for a full example.

## Cloudflare-protected targets

Standard HTTP clients fail against Cloudflare because their TLS fingerprint
is identifiable as non-browser traffic.  Ladon's optional curl-cffi backend
impersonates a real browser's TLS `ClientHello` to bypass L1 and L2 challenges
without a browser process.

```bash
pip install ladon-crawl[cffi]   # adds curl-cffi (binary wheel, ~10 MB)
```

```python
from ladon.networking import make_http_client
from ladon.networking.config import HttpClientConfig

config = HttpClientConfig(
    backend="curl-cffi",
    impersonate="chrome136",
    timeout_seconds=20.0,
    retries=2,
)
with make_http_client(config) as client:
    result = client.get("https://protected-target.example/")
```

`make_http_client()` and `make_async_http_client()` dispatch on
`config.backend` — change one field to switch backends with no call-site
changes.  All policies (retries, circuit breaker, proxy rotation, rate
limiting) are identical to the standard backends.

See the [Cloudflare bypass guide](docs/guides/cloudflare-bypass.md) for the
full layer-by-layer breakdown, impersonate target list, and L3 (IP reputation)
considerations.

## Async crawling

`async_run_plugin()` is the asyncio-native whole-plugin entry point. It
discovers roots once and processes them in source order; for each root, Phase 1
(expander traversal) runs sequentially and Phase 3 issues leaf fetches
concurrently behind `asyncio.Semaphore(config.async_concurrency)` (default 10):

```python
import asyncio
from ladon import AsyncHttpClient, async_run_plugin
from ladon.networking.config import HttpClientConfig
from ladon.runner import RunConfig

async def main() -> None:
    config = HttpClientConfig(retries=2, timeout_seconds=10)
    async with AsyncHttpClient(config) as client:
        result = await async_run_plugin(
            plugin=my_async_plugin,
            client=client,
            config=RunConfig(async_concurrency=20),
            on_leaf=my_async_persist,
        )
        print(f"consumed {result.leaves_consumed}, failed {result.leaves_failed}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

`AsyncHttpClient` mirrors all policies of `HttpClient` (retries, backoff,
Retry-After, circuit breaker, proxy rotation, auth) using `httpx` as the
backend. Adapters implement `AsyncCrawlPlugin`, `AsyncSource`, `AsyncExpander`,
and `AsyncSink` — the same structural-protocol pattern as the sync stack.

## Status

`v0.3.2` — plan/execute crawl phases, observability, and multi-source
resolution. `AsyncHttpClient`, `AsyncCrawlPlugin`, `async_run_crawl()`, and
their sync equivalents are stable and fully tested.

What was added in v0.3.2:
- **Plan/execute split** — `plan_crawl()` / `execute_plan()` (and their sync
  equivalents) separate traversal from leaf fetching, letting callers filter
  or limit a `CrawlPlan` before consuming it (ADR-016)
- **Observability** — `DecisionEvent`, `DecisionTracker`, and
  `MultiSourceSink.resolve_multi()` decision-event instrumentation
- **`MultiSourceSink` / `FetchPredicate`** — a shared try-until-accepted
  resolution loop for Sinks backed by multiple ranked sources (ADR-013)

What was added in v0.3.0:
- **Cloudflare bypass** — `CurlHttpClient` / `AsyncCurlHttpClient` via
  curl-cffi, `HttpClientConfig(backend="curl-cffi", impersonate="chrome136")`,
  `make_http_client()` / `make_async_http_client()` factories (issue [#107](https://github.com/MoonyFringers/ladon/issues/107))

What was added in v0.2.0:
- **Async crawling** — `async_run_crawl()` + `AsyncHttpClient` (httpx backend)
- **Async plugin protocols** — `AsyncSource`, `AsyncExpander`, `AsyncSink`, `AsyncCrawlPlugin`
- `RunConfig.async_concurrency` — bounded leaf-fetch concurrency (default 10)

What was added in v0.1.0:
- HTTP 429/503 Retry-After respect and full-jitter backoff
- Static and rotating proxy support (`ProxyPool`, `RoundRobinProxyPool`)
- HTTP authentication — Basic, Digest, any `requests.auth.AuthBase`
- Default query parameters via `HttpClientConfig(default_params=...)`

What was added in v0.0.1:
- SES protocol (Source / Expander / Sink) with structural typing
- `run_crawl()` runner with leaf isolation and `RunResult` summary
- `HttpClient` with retries, back-off, rate limiting, circuit breaker, robots.txt
- `Storage` protocol with `LocalFileStorage`
- `Repository` and `RunAudit` persistence protocols with `NullRepository`
- `ladon run` / `ladon info` CLI

What is coming:
- Async robots.txt enforcement in `AsyncHttpClient`
- Structured logging baseline (ADR-009)
